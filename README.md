<h1>Introduction</h1>

This project is a game, called PunkBoy School Game.  The main purpose of this project is to complete the requirements of the "Programozási környezetek" course.
While gaming, you need to choose from a few reactions for a situation. 
For example, at the beginning of the game your character wakes up, and you can decide if you want to play a game all day, or be productive and go to school, and so on.
To successfully complete the game, you need to choose the right reactions, and to collect 100 intelligence points.
